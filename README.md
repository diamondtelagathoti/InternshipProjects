1. Object Detection Using TensorFlow Object Detection API.
   * Integrated TensorFlow Object Detection API with OpenCV for real-time processing of video stream from webcam and IP Camera.  
   * Trained the model on my own-dataset ``i.e Pen``, after training, the model is able to detect Pen in a ``.jpg`` image with ``>90%`` score.  

2. Integration of JIRA REST API with MySQL Database, for Bug Reporting.
   * Bug Reports are stored in MySQL Database, Used JIRA REST API to log Bug Reports directly into JIRA Project.
