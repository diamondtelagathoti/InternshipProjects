# Object Detection Using TensorFlow  
This repository contains the works which I have done using TensorFlow Object Detection API. Before running the code, you need to first install tensorflow and all its dependecies.  

### Installation: ###
- - - -
```System: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or later```  

``pip`` is a python package manager used for installing all the modules, if ``pip`` is not installed, then run the following command before insalling dependencies:  

 * Installing ```Pip```  
```
For python 2.7:
	sudo apt-get -y install python-pip python-dev build-essential  
	sudo pip install --upgrade pip  
For python 3:  
	sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip  
	pip3 -version (For checking the version of pip3)  
```
 * Installing Dependencies:  
```
For python 2.7:  
	sudo pip install -r dependencies.txt  
For python 3:  
	sudo pip3 install -r dependencies.txt  
```
Note: ```dependencies.txt``` file contains all the dependencies/packages in order to run TensorFlow.  
* After installing the TensorFlow 1.5.0, and all the dependencies, run the following command,  
	``sudo apt-get install python3-tk (For installing tkinter library)``  

* In python interpreter, run the following commands to check whether TensorFlow is installed sucessfully:  
```
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__) #print the version of TensorFlow installed in your system.
```

#### OpenCV Installation: ####
- - - -
* I am using ``OpenCV`` for implementing the object detection in real-time, you need to install ``OpenCV`` also.  
* Refer the below link for installation
